                a vyhlasujú ich za ohromné činy prispievajúce k šťastiu a blahu ľudského pokolenia - šťastný, kto

<br>Will there be a recession in 2019?
<br>Don't incentivize consumers to stop buying! Buying creates jobs, creates industries, creates more money organically.
<br>-
<br>Anything that reduces consumer demand hurts the economy. Period.
<br>Higher taxes mean less people with demand to buy products
<br>Recession in the US occurs when -
<br>First someone on Wall Street comes up with a new way to make money.
<br>Then, a ton of money is made (sending the market to highs), then Wall Street goes ravenous with greed, then it comes crashing down and recession results.
<br>-
<br>Don't panic. Live your life. Kiss someone every day.
<br>- 
<br>Any possible reason of recession? There is no war affecting our economy, cryptocurrencies are Sillicon Valley invention and not Wall Street, and banks have been heavily regulated lately amd have no opportunities to go crazy.

<br><br>

<br>Yesterday night I went to a bookstore. I wanted to buy a book for J. It was soon before store closes. 
<br>I already knew which book I want to buy. I asked a lady where to quickly find it. After a while I was holding the book I wanted and waiting in a line at cashiers. 
<br>At the cashiers desk I noticed I noticed a history book about Hong Kong among some other featured books. 
<br>The announcement told that store will be closed in 10 mins and kindly asked customers to finish their purchases.
<br>I left the line to quickly take a look. It was a set of colorized photos telling stories from colonial times from Hong Kong's early days to its golden age.
<br>The photos were so eye catching that I could spend watching for hours on each and envision myself being a part of stories from decades ago. Colors brought them to although only focal parts of photographs were colorized.
<br>Another announcement reminded that store will be closed in 5 mins.
<br>I wanted to speed up my pace to briefly explore more chapters of the book. But the photos were so stunning that i couldnt move faster than one by one. I didnt want to miss out anything
<br>Finally the last announcement told that the time is up. I was still at the first pages. I closed the book and got back to the line and purchased the  book I came for.

<br>Relativity is the idea that an observer cannot truly understand a system of which he himself is a part. For example, a man inside an airplane does not feel like he is experiencing movement, but an outside observer can see that movement is occurring. This form of relativity tends to affect social systems in a similar way.

<br>Leverage
<br>Archimedes, “Give me a lever long enough and I shall move the world.” With a small amount of input force, we can make a great output force through leverage. Understanding where we can apply this model to the human world can be a source of great success.
<br><br>
<br>Alloying - zliatina
<br> the alloy can be far stronger than the simple addition of elements
<br>This process leads us to engineer great physical objects, but we understand many intangibles in the same way; a combination of the right elements in social systems or even individuals can create a 2+2=6 effect similar to alloying.

<br>Let's say you have to do a bunch of outreach. "I'm a natural introvert. So I have to get up and put my extrovert hat on."

<br>By chunking outreach all in one day, he can stay in the extrovert mindset. And even prep for it.

<br>Trénuj celé frázy, nie slová. Keď aj budes vyslovovať vsetko plocho, časom sa zlepšíš. Choď do 茶餐廳, tam sa ľudia radi budú s tebou rozprávať. Skús im povedať, že máš rád kura alebo spýtať, čo by ti odporučili.

<br>If hou control categorisation and rankings, you control how people use them and what they think.
<br>Categories - assuming how things work. Wrong category - confusion, missed opportunity
<br>Modern art - reaction on thousands years of arts. Now we have cameeas why dont need to paint to make it look like a photograph was taken. 
<br>Categories no longer matter - crowdsourced labeling - infinite categories. Thanks to technology you can directly get to things you are looking for.
<br>Putting someone to category does no longer matter - output what you can see matters more. You dont look for birds to find animals that can fly. You want to look for flying animals (may include squirrels)
<br><br>


<br>Sometimes you just feel down. It can be caused by an embarrasing moment that's still in your fresh memory. Maybe you acted bad at certain situation or feel others mistreated you.
<br>Everytime I feel down I use a following trick. I ask myself, how would i acted, if this was the most awesome day of my life? How would I look if I made a million today? 
<br>If you're walking on the street, no one needs to see how you really feel. 
<br>Confidence is an ability to convince others to see you how you want them to see.
<br>If you feel down it's because it's your choice. If you can't get over it you may keep yourself from opportunities that can restore your inner mood.
<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br>I am terrible at communication. When I want to express something that I really care I almost always fail. I suddenly stop in the middle of the sentence. I feel like my brain stops working and my mind goes blank. There are no more words coming. There's just void. Its like when a city gets blackout. 
<br>Believe me, it has caused me many embarrassing moments.
<br>On the other side, simetimes my mind can become bright and extremely creative. It generates one idea after another. I immediately start writing them down. I grab pen and paper or open note taking app - whatever is closest to me. It's so fast that I can hardly keep the pace.
<br>These moments come spontaneously. They always walk in quietely. If I open myself to them they can turn into a massive flow of inspiration.
<br>
<br><br>
<br>The best ideas and the best creative work are always triggered by something. There is always some level of discomfort before they are born and developed.
<br>If you dont feel dissatisfaction or frustration during your process, you probably don't get the best out of you.

<br>Seth Godin. Self-publishing books
<br>- Share your thoughts with your audience, you will get their trust and credibility
<br>- Do the emotional labor that brings book in format that people want to touch that teaches them what you want to teach.
<br>- do the work of sharing your ideas - publish a blog post each day with no cost. Charging for book - its nice to make living by something you care about.
<br>If someone buys your idea, they treat it with morr respect. They focus more energy on that. Comes in different package
<br>- dont keep track on bestsellrrs, it doesnt matter
<br>- start promoting your ideas 3 years before it comes out. You need to build the permission asset and credibility, so when it comes people will buy it.
<br>- buying a book by cover sends same message as buyng shoes - buyng a bood sboes makes you better than you are. People will judge you.
<br>- you dont do that for everyone, you do that for someone.

<br>You are trying to allocate resources. you cannot cannibalise more urgent tasks, Treat yourself as two persons - a contractor and client.

<br>Whats our philosophy. Think about this before you start solving any problem?

<br>1. What is Lalamove? Should be
<br>2. What defines it?
<br>- its all about how you see it.
<br>I want to find a philosophy 
<br>3 ways of matching solutions to problems
<br>1. Direct
<br>2. Step back, look how others do that, find patterns.
<br>3. Define approach/thinking/ philosophy - this is who we are, this is how we do things - which will show only ways how to do that.
<br>Technically all can ve correct
<br>This is Not about finding correct one, its about finding/identifying right ones.
<br>- if this is done, you will be able to solve not only this one, but even bigger problems and with simpicity and elegance.
<br>I am doing this because this is what we're missing. We are looking only for technically correct solutions, not thinking DEEPER.
<br>-
<br>This is how i see it ...given that, this is a direction that makes sense to me. - but these are two different things. 
<br>I dont see anything wrongbqbout the option (sometimes it works, somewhere it creates friction), its more about how you communicate that.
<br>Games - learn everything within first 4 levels.
<br>What are our values.
<br>Lets not only look for solutions that are technically correct, but think if they are inline with some values.
<br>--
<br>Think what are our values, whays our philosophy.
<br>These questions can quide you.
<br>-
<br>3. How do you want to be seen?
<br>-
<br>We wanted to take this as a creative session.
<br>-
<br>If we are unable to figure out whats our driving force,...
<br>-
<br>Social platform - what do we do for that? How do you know that driver is the best choice for you.
<br>I have seen huge disappointments. As a client you have no power before it gets too late.
<br>- 
<br>This is the current solution that causes problem.
<br>----
<br>1 You can never solve it for every single problem. But fixing 20 most common cases will fix 80problems
<br>2 how do you make someone feelthat yhis platform truly cares about people. Give human touch?
<br>"People choose this for..."
<br>-
<br>You may agree with philosophy, but you may argue its not possible because of interface limits.
<br>-
<br>What solutiins we want
<br>- 
<br>How do you want to define brand? Its more tgan a styleguide and library

<br>I started learning to play on ukulele. 3 weeks ago I commited myself to perform in front of 400 people. Never held ukulele in hands before and have no experience with playing an musical instrument.
<br>I did that for two things:
<br>1 I like pushing myslef to situaitions that cause me some leveldiscomfort. I found its the most effective way to learn new things and stretch your comfort zone
<br>2 research shows that playing on musical instrument boosts your brain activity. Measuring brain activity of pleople playing musical instruments shows there are literally fireworks happening in their brains. When you play its like a workout for your brain. Now I find myslef more creative and confident.
<br>My perfomance is this Friday. Although I thought i am not capable of playing ukulele, everybody can learn to play a few songs in a month with a proper guidance.

<br>Its very important to design logic to be able to solve way bigger problems.
<br>1 referral and coaching program
<br>2  own incentives
<br>3 3rd parties incentives and loyalty programs
<br>4 personalized and predivtive on individual level
<br>You DONT NEED TO spend your own money on challenged
<br>We can open the same engine to 3rd parties to spend their own money incentivize drivers - brands and business can build loyal community of drivers - (lotalty programs) i will fight to take kfc, because they will pay me extra for good rating
<br>Personalized campaigns - build on behavior of similar drivers - take two more orders before you wrap up
<br>Marketing engine.  Build for ondemand campaigns. You can hardcode partd which dont move often. But Dont do any shortcuts. Will create tech and design debt which will hit you painfully one day. 
<br>Build for future problems, not present problems.
<br>-
<br>Challenges + Analytics
<br>Go to analytics, check your delivery data and there is a tip - hey, businesses like you are engaging drivers through challenges. Go to Challenge manager and we will tell you how to set up your first challenge.
<br>Once you lauch you can return to Analytics to track.
<br>We rewarded our drivers and our deliveries got delivered faster.
<br>Here's what mathematics say: if everybody os using that to take advamtage, you have to too.
<br>If you make enough people to use something what gis them advanfage, you force others to use it too
<br>If you come to casino and everybody is buying extra chips, you have to too, because your betting power would be weaker.
<br>-
<br>Everytime when you can target to a group ofpeopleyou can find a way to monetize that. When you can find a specific type people, you can also find someonewho has a message for them . 
<br>This is qhat we are already doing. I have a box, who wants to deliver it to...?
<br>-
<br>I dont think you can find..: thischqllenges  an exectution - . The principle works.
<br>-
<br>Resign, start a company who builds tgat and sell it to any logistics company.
<br>-
<br>Business value in Marketing Engine
<br>Referrals - focus on operation - save money
<br>Marketing - focus on innovation - creating a new business - create money
<br>-
<br>There is a referral program.
<br>On top of it there is an engine, which takes a message and find people who will see it.
<br>On right there is an analytics which tells you how it went.
<br>-
<br>This is an idea for business plan that works in any emvironment.
<br>If you can build a tech that can be plugged to any type of data and can target them and deliver any type of task and you can measure how effective it is, you can start a company.o
<br>This is what we're doin in R4 and R5.
<br>---
<br>Test campaigns. We tried 10 orders but we had better results when we did 5. Maybe 10 is too much

<br>Why would we pay seasonal incentives if they can s that by themselves? I want to motivate drivers at the afternoon, i will create quest!

<br>- motto of this release
<br><br>
<br>Things what take you ages to achieve, now they thaks seconds
<br><br>
<br>Dead time vs Alive time
<br>Dead time - passive and binding
<br>Alive - learning and leveraging every second towards their intended future
<br><br>
<br>Lalamove. Pear.
<br>Empathy
<br>I see them doing things manually
<br>Thye need a better way to manage things effeciently.
<br>Figma.
<br>Spend time on things that matter.
<br>Things are getting quickly. 
<br>Charles day 1 - brisf, day 2 - prototype, day 3 - review, day 4 - building
<br>20 time burnt on feedback loop - exporting to another tool, documenting work, so another people can review + many limits that cannot be solver
<br>Actual design work takes only 20 percent of my time - time is gwtting even more precious. To keep the pace, i need to think how can i reduce those small 20 percent.
<br>I have used figma on some tasks with admin panel - speed work, zro time handoff, no information is lost on handoff, dev see waht designer does.
<br>I can keep up the same pace only if i use figma.
<br>Downside - fragments design work, workflow problem, this tool is really taking off, i see it all across community and use it for freelancing,.
<br>Sketch is already building same collaboration tools, comes too late
<br>other side - lifetime of design is very short, the older it gets, more it needs to be changed. 30 percent sites need complete redesign.
<br>It doesmt matter where you store your work, what matters more is how fast you are.
<br>----
<br>- i am not satisfied with our workflow.
<br>As a result I am not disciplined in compling some tasks.
<br>- if i keep it for myslelf i am the person who will suffer the most. Not only me, will be criticised for being undisciined -> on place, but there are some root causes
<br>-
<br>working with Remote team requires different workflow and tools
<br>Design debt, devs requesting accurate guidelines #talk to andrew - show figma handoff, think of yourself you need to build that, take your time to think (no principles, no rules, guidance, unwanted styles)
<br>Lot of tike spent on handoff+documemting, not useful at all.
<br>#
<br>- i wanted to open a discussion
<br>- either sacrifice productivity or teamwork
<br>- like relationship single vs taken - if you think there's somethine thats bemeficial for teamwork, its fair to bring that up to table
<br>- --
<br>I took it from wrong end.
<br>Never ever make the same mistake.
<br>I started talking about the solution and then  moved on to problem.
<br>People rejected my solution and didnt listen to the problem.
<br>To do instead: talk about problem, make sure they understand and agree. Ask if you see it too. - or whoever else. Never translate to solution immediately if they dont understa d problem. They wont the solution tool
<br>-
<br>Valudate problems (w engineers). Show how to solve, do not show solution
<br>- 
<br>Tools that we use always limit communication, thats either missing or another effort is needed 
<br>-
<br>Need guidelines, no matter what i do will not solve ptoblem. Will be unclear, hard to follow.
<br>Not obly my call - they have their say too. Any tool is ineffective if you dont use it properly - ask them to show you examples of what works
<br>- otherwiae problems would remain
<br>--
<br>Any problem is solvable with right thinking
<br>#
<br>--
<br>Ask on ideal handoff tool- how do you want to receuve designs, what do you need to read, what you think, qhat you saw elsewhere
<br>-
<br>Andrew: i think design-dev workflow is far from ideal, 
<br>Communication, principles, rules to follow
<br>there is a lot of ineffeciencies,
<br>Want to talk to you to find imprivements
<br>- coordinate design and dev.
<br>---
<br>Asked to create some rules, they dont know how.
<br>- what should i do? Create a page in confluence? Another wiki? Add more notes to library?
<br>Whats root cause - no design-dev intersection. No one ever asked me on something, but i saw things wrong
<br>More openness - you get access to library, you show me how you use it.

<br>To understand spirituality need to define religion.
<br>Focal point of religion is God.

<br>Why wrong 
<br>-
<br>Tangible
<br>Centralized
<br>-
<br>Concept - think of it as a force. Its not concentrared only on one place.
<br>Its not only in skies, its around you. In air, under ground, far beyound atmosphere, it fills all space known and unknown to you.
<br>It existed for always and cannot be disappear.
<br>Physicist - calls it energy. Says its  everywhere around you, all things are made from  it. Its existed since .. and cannot be destroyed. He adds changes its forms
<br>-
<br>They both are trying to understand it, how it impacts their luves, understanf law of tge attraction.

<br>When you're in restaurant, would you get the best food by ordering a signature dish? I think you shouldn't trust restaurants recomendations.
<br>If you are a restaurant, the more people order your recommeded dishes, the higher is your temptation to please more people by averaging the taste.
<br>What it means to you is, that you can discover richer tastes by trying not recommended items in the menu.
<br>To bring this into different light, sometimes you can get better outcomes by not following what everybody else does.
